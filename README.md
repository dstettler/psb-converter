# `psb-converter`

This repo is the home of psb-converter, a program that converts raw image arrays (which can be generated from common formats with `rbm-converter.py`) into my `psb` image format.
It's mostly just a way for me to play around with concepts behind image compression, and isn't anything too serious. 
I'll update this README as I work out a, well, working version.
